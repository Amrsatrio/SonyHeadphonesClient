|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Current Playing                          | **?** (does not seem to work - may not be a problem with the device itself)  |
| Sound Pressure                           | **?** (shows zero)                                |
| Battery Life                             | **?** (showing 100% on R when standard BT protocol shows 90%)   |
| Volume                                   | ✅                                 |

| Map Headphone Gestures to Shell Commands | ✅ ❌ (gui has errors preventing config update, but does work after manual TOML configuration changes)                                |
